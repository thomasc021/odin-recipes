<h2>Delicous Apple Crumble In Under 1 Hour!</h2>
<p>"A family favorite, this apple crumble was originally my grandmother Hazel's recipe which my mom made on a regular basis. She would make two at a time to take to sick or shut-in friends, or to potlucks. There is never any left. Serve warm with French vanilla yogurt." </p>
